# Coal's Law Analysis

This project explores **Coal's Law**, a theoretical model (or principle) applied within a specific domain, demonstrating its relevance through data analysis. The analysis is carried out using a Jupyter Notebook, where the data is processed and visualized to validate the law's assumptions and conclusions.

## Project Structure

- **updated coal's law.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook that contains the implementation and analysis of Coal's Law.
- **Dataset**: The data used in the notebook for the analysis of Coal's Law is processed to demonstrate the principle through practical examples.

## Key Concepts

The notebook includes:
1. **Data preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Analysis of Coal's Law**: Applying the theory to the dataset and examining its outcomes.
